# Genshin Material Data

This is where I will put data related to Genshin Impact characters, weapons, and related entities for ascension and talent leveling.

The repository consists of data and scripts used to extract and update data. Its main purpose is to provide data in SQLite format.

**The data here is not mine, it belongs to its rightful owner(s).** I just organized it in way convinent to me.

## Organization

The [src](/src) is where the source code is (`index.ts` aside), [images](/images) is where all images will go, and, lastly, `database-script.sql` is a sqlite script to create and fill the database.

## Extraction

The data was extracted mostly from [genshin's fandom wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/), and some data was manually entered.
