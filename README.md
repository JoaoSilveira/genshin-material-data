# Genshin Material Data

This is where I will put data related to Genshin Impact characters, weapons, and related entities for ascension and talent leveling.

The repository consists of data and scripts used to extract and update data.

## Organization

The [src](/src) is where the source code is (`index.ts` aside), [images](/images) is where all images will go, and, lastly, `database-script.sql` is a sqlite script to create and fill the database.

## Extraction

The data was extracted mostly from [genshin's fandom wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/), and some data was manually entered.
